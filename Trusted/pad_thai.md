# Ingredients - For the sauce:

* 1 table-spoon fish sauce (can use soy sauce instead)
* 2 table-spoons sugar
* 1/2-2 tea-spoons tamarind concentrate (I used 2 and loved it, but Lauren thought it was way too acidic)
* 2 table-spoons ketchup
* 1 tea-spoon soy sauce (very optional)


* It's possible to replace both the fish sauce and tamarind with 3-4 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. Not the same, but pretty good.

# Ingredients - Everything else:

* 1 bunch green onions
* 1 thumb of ginger
* 3-4 garlic cloves
* 1 red chili (very optional)
* 4-8 oz (60-120g) mung bean sprouts (I like a lot of them)
* 4 oz (60g) Pad Thai noodles (narrow, flat rice noodles)
* 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (shrimp or tofu work great too)
* 2 eggs
* a big handful of roasted peanuts (50g?)
* picked cilantro leaves and lime wedges for garnish
* salt
* oil

Mix up the sauce and let the sugar dissolve while you do everything else. Put a big pinch of salt in the eggs and beat them thoroughly â€” let them sit and loosen while you do the rest. Coarsely chop the peanuts.

Thinly slice the green onions, keeping the greens and whites separate. Peel and coarsely chop the garlic and ginger, and put them in the same bowl as your onion greens. Thinly slice the chili and put it in with the onions and ginger/garlic. Pick the cilantro leaves and cut the lime wedges.

Cut the chicken into three sections and then into very thin slices against the grain. Separate into two piles. Get the bean sprouts open and ready, get your salt and a glass of water handy.

Using noodles from cold water. Added after chicken.
~~Fill a nonstick pan with water (not the water you have in the glass) and bring it to a boil. Put in a pinch of salt and the noodles. Cook, stirring constantly, for half as long as the package suggests (I did 2-3 minutes). Dump them in a strainer and pour cold water over them to stop the cooking and keep them from sticking to each other. Leave them in the strainer for now.~~

Wipe out the pan and return it to the high heat, and put in a thin film of oil. Season the first pile of chicken with salt. When the oil just starts to smoke, put in the chicken and quickly get it spread out to a thin layer. Let it brown without moving it for a minute.

When the chicken pieces are opaque 2/3rds of the way up, put in half of your onion/ginger/garlic/chili mixture and stir it aggressively. Push it over to one side of the pan (it's ok that the chicken and veg aren't fully cooked yet), then pour half of the eggs into the other side and get them spread out to a thin layer. Let the egg partially solidify before breaking it up into sheets with your spoon. 

When egg seems almost cooked, dump in half the noodles, a third of the sauce (you can always add more sauce if you think it needs it), half the bean sprouts, a few chopped peanuts, and stir to combine. Finally, use a splash of water from the glass to help you get everything stirred up, deglaze the pan, and get the level of saucy texture you want. 

Put it on a plate, garnish with the cilantro, onion greens, lime wedges and more peanuts. Wipe out the pan and cook the second portion. (It's possible to cook both at once if you have a wok or a really big nonstick pan with a really powerful burner, but I think this comes out better if you do one at a time so it can get the necessary intense heat.)

I was sous-chef at a fantastic Thai restaurant doing upscale street food, very briefly. Here are some pointers:

First, don't par-boil the rice noodles. Soak them in cold water for an hour, then in a basket splash them in boiling water for literally 1-2 seconds before throwing into the pan once your protein, veg and eggs are 90% ready. Fry them until a bit dry, and then finish with the sauce, green onions, and some bean sprouts. This is how you get that firm noodle that is so important to a good pad thai.  Otherwise the noodles will be a bit slimy or sticky.

Second: My Thai chef started literally every dish done on the stove with a neutral oil and browned garlic. Be careful not to burn it, but get medium-gold to permeate that nutty taste through the whole dish. The chicken coming straight out of the fridge should cool the pan enough to prevent it burning, but it should be a dark brown by the time the noodles go in. It is counter-intuitive for French-trained chefs like me because we're told to never over-cook garlic, but apparently it is key for Thai street food.

Third: This is more personal preference (as all things I suppose), but don't use a stick-free pan and instead beat the egg with chopsticks right in the pan. It has a different taste when the yolks and whites cook separately. I don't worry about them drying out because the water from the noodles and sauce should prevent that, and they're supposed to provide a complex texture anyway.

Fourth: Use bean sprouts in the pan and also as garnish.

Otherwise you've got a really good approach here. I wouldn't ever do more than one portion at a time at home! Even with an industrial kitchen we would do no more than 3, and usually only 2. Quality will always be better with fewer portions because you really don't want everything to get a chance to over-steam itself (there is the goopy noodle problem again).

So next time try soaking the noodles in cold water for an hour and just splashing them in boiling water for a second, and also browning the garlic. I bet you'll be even more pleased with your results
